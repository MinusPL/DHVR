Each round consists of a total of ten targets to shoot. Depending on the game mode the player selects prior to beginning play, 
one or two targets will appear on the screen at any given time and the player has three shots, or attempts, to hit them 
before they disappear.[6]

The player is required to successfully shoot a minimum number of targets in order to advance to the next round; failure will result in a game over. 
The difficulty increases as the player advances to higher rounds; targets will move faster and the minimum number of targets to shoot will increase. 
The player receives points upon shooting a target and will also receive bonus points for shooting all ten targets in a single round. Duck Hunt keeps track of the players' 
highest score for all games played in a single session; it is lost, however, upon shutting the game off.
